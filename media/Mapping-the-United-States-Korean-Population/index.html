<p>I’ve often felt fortunate that I get <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/matt-stiles-los-angeles-times-stories/">to write</a> about South Korea for the <em><a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/">Los Angeles Times</a></em>, a newspaper that’s still interested in stories related to life, politics and culture here — not just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un">strongman</a> to the North.</p>
<p>That interest is in part because the <em>Times</em> remains a serious paper that’s trying to stay committed to foreign news, but also because a decent portion of its readers are Korean. The Los Angeles metro area, for example, has more than 340,000 people of Korean descent, about a fifth of the overall Korean population in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/2015/03/17/south-korean-emigration-at-record-low-where-do-overseas-koreans-live-now">written before</a> about South Korean expatriates overseas. These maps, however, show the population of all ethnic Koreans who have settled in Los Angeles and across the United States.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Los Angeles and a caveat: I may write for the Times, but I don’t yet know its geography (especially not like <a href="http://datadesk.latimes.com">these</a> <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/2018/01/23/mapping-the-united-states-korean-population/boundaries.latimes.com">fine folks</a>).</p>
<p>This map shows Los Angeles County, which has about 230,000 people of Korean ancestry, according to the 2010* Census. The deep teal colors in the center of the county reflect the population of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreatown,_Los_Angeles">Koreatown</a>, a neighborhood inside the city of Los Angeles. This place is <em>legit</em> Korean. There’s even a <a href="http://parisbaguette.com/">Paris Baguette</a>! There are several suburban areas, such as Glendale, north of Koreatown, that also have a relatively high proportion of Korean residents.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>This map shows the Korean share across the country, by county. Most counties have tiny proportions of Koreans. (My home county in East Texas had a grand total of 194 Koreans, or about 0.16 percent of its population). Other areas, such as Southern California, the mid-Atlantic coast and the New York metro area have comparatively large Korean populations.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>This map uses the same data set but a different visualization technique — proportional symbols, not shaded county boundaries. Larger symbols, or bubbles, represent a higher number of Koreans in raw figures, not proportions.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>And, finally, here are two tables with the top 25 counties by both measures — proportion and population:</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>* <em>I chose this data set because it was the last hard count of all Americans by the Census Bureau. The agency also conducts large, quality surveys between each decennial census, but detailed questions, such as specific ancestral or ethnic origin, can come with high margins of error at smaller geography levels. The hard count also isn’t perfect, but it’s the best we have for national county-level maps until 2020. </em></p>
