    <p>Investigators <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/world/europe/germanwings-airbus-crash.html">still want to know</a> what caused a civilian airliner to crash Tuesday morning in the French Alps. The incident, which likely killed 144 passengers and six crew members aboard the Airbus A320 destined for Germany, is one of <a href="http://www.baaa-acro.com/advanced-search-result/?type=crash&amp;display=entry&amp;year_post=2015&amp;continent=0&amp;country=0&amp;pavillon=0&amp;aircraft=0&amp;operator=0&amp;cause=0&amp;et_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess">at least 17 major crashes this year</a>, according to the <a href="http://www.baaa-acro.com/">Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives</a>.</p>
<p>The group maintains a <a href="http://www.baaa-acro.com/general-statistics/">detailed database</a> of each crash back to 1918, the early days of flight, allowing users to search 22,000 cases by year, operator, plane type and cause, among several other variables. This one is at least the 18th involving an Airbus A320, according to the <a href="http://www.baaa-acro.com/advanced-search/">database</a>.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the number of crashes catalogued by the group during that time. You can see a spike in <a href="http://www.baaa-acro.com/advanced-search-result/?type=crash&amp;display=entry&amp;year_post=1944&amp;continent=0&amp;country=0&amp;pavillon=0&amp;aircraft=0&amp;operator=0&amp;cause=0&amp;et_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess">1944</a>, during World War II, when many military aircraft went down in battle, resulting in more than 4,300 casualties:</p>
<p>Since then, the number of crashes peaked in <a href="http://www.baaa-acro.com/advanced-search-result/?type=crash&amp;display=entry&amp;year_post=1978&amp;continent=0&amp;country=0&amp;pavillon=0&amp;aircraft=0&amp;operator=0&amp;cause=0&amp;et_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess">1978</a> and has declined over time. There were about 120 crashes last year, according to the bureauâ€™s records.</p>
