    <p>It’s been a bit more wintry in Washington, D.C., this winter. More so than usual, as one might guess from today’s snowfall.</p>
<p>The average annual snowfall total in the last three decades, according to the National Weather Service, is about 15 inches. This year we’ve received about 26 inches (and counting, as I look out the window). Last year, though, we received only about 3 inches of snow.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a strange year. Here’s a chart of snowfall totals by month over time. This February and March were unusual:</p>
