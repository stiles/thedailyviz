<p><em>I’m in Taiwan this month to study Mandarin. During breaks, I’ll be posting occasionally about the island nation’s demographics, politics and (sticky) weather. </em></p>
<p>Like other East Asian democracies, such as South Korea and Japan, Taiwan has a <a href="http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201602090008.aspx">rapidly aging population</a>, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-china-population-idUSKBN0UA0MO20151227">posing demographic and economic challenges</a> for policy makers.</p>
<p>One reason for the age increase is that Taiwan has among the lowest birth rates in the world. These charts highlight the trend.  Here’s the birth rate over time — with the United States, the world and East Asia for context:</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>With fewer births, the nation’s median age has increased dramatically in the last three decades:</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The aging change is particularly evident when you consider the relative proportion of specific age groups over time:</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The data are a bit easier to digest when the age groups are grouped more broadly. The proportion of residents at age 65 or older, for example, has more than doubled since 1985.</p>
