    <p>USA Today <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/drought/story/2012-04-11/mild-winter-expands-usa-drought/54225018/1">reports</a> that the country hasn’t been this “dry” in five years:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Still reeling from devastating drought that led to at least $10 billion in agricultural losses across Texas and the South in 2011, the nation is enduring more unusually parched weather.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The map uses the same data <a href="http://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/drought/">we at NPR used recently to map conditions in Texas</a>, which endured the worst drought in its history last year. The map shows the full country, for context, and allows users to see an animated view week-by-week from summer 2010 to last month. <a href="http://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/drought/">Check it out</a>.</p>
