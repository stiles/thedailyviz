    <p>Has European football gotten increasingly boring over the years? If you like offense, perhaps.</p>
<p>Since the mid-1950s, fewer and fewer goals on average have been scored per match. The trend is evident among the major national leagues (Spain, Italy, England and Germany) and also the Champions League, in which the best teams from each country compete for a European title.</p>
<p>Goals per match in the latter championship, formerly known as the European Cup, are down the most (-39%) since 1955 — followed by Spain’s <em>La Liga</em> (-30%), England’s Premier League (-14%) and Italy’s <em>Serie A</em> (-9%). Per-match goals in Germany’s <em>Bundesliga</em> are down 21% since 1964, the earliest data available.</p>
<p>This chart, made in Adobe Illustrator, attempts to the visualize the trend:</p>
