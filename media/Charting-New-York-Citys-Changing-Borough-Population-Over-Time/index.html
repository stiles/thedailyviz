<p>I woke one recent morning at 5 a.m. obsessing about, of all things, the people of New York City — specifically how the population is distributed among the five boroughs: Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island. And how that’s changed over time.</p>
<p>I had a general idea. But my nerd brain <em>needed</em> to know for sure. So I went to Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City#Historical_population_data">data</a>. These charts show the total population, by borough, since 1790.</p>

<p>This chart shows how the proportion of New York City residents in each borough has shifted over time. Decades ago, Manhattan was the center of population. Not anymore, of course:</p>
