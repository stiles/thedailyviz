    <p>NASA flew more than 130 space shuttle missions since the vehicle went into orbital use in the early 1980s, and today the agency <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/04/photos-discovery-shuttles-last-flight-over-washington-dc/51222/">wowed</a> many in D.C. with a landing at Dulles International Airport. (Yes, they are making poor Discovery commute in to the city from Dulles). Together, the shuttles have spent more than 1,300 days in flight.</p>
<p>This chart shows their total time in orbital flights. Discovery spent about a year in the air, more than its sister shuttles:</p>

<p>And their total flights during those missions:</p>
