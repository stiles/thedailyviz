    <p>Last year on my birthday I created a <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/2012/05/12/how-common-is-your-birthday/">quick heatmap</a> visualizing birthdays by their rank on the calendar. Despite its <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/2012/05/18/how-common-is-your-birthday-pt-2/">flaws</a>, the graphic went viral by The Daily Viz standards, receiving a quarter million views.</p>
<p>Most of the attention came in the month of May 2012. But what’s been interesting is its long-tail appeal. Every few months or so my traffic spikes — and I always know why. It has been viewed 100,000 times in the last year. This chart from Google Analytics shows the spikes, including one in recent days thanks to links from <a href="http://wnycradiolab.tumblr.com/post/52307654304/i-knew-it-which-birth-dates-are-most-common">Radiolab</a> and <a href="http://io9.com/how-common-is-your-birthday-512052896">io9</a>.</p>

<p>Last fall, around the time that birthdays are most common, my wife and I had a baby, <a href="http://evaeveryday.tumblr.com/">Eva</a>, and I’ve found it difficult to keep this blog “daily” while also focusing on <a href="http://blog.apps.npr.org">my day job</a>. I’m using this most recent traffic spike as inspiration to get blogging again.</p>
<p>I hope, someday soon, to create something that’s more popular than that silly heatmap. Stay tuned.</p>
