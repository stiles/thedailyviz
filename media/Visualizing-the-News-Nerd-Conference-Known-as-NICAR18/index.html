<p>I’m in the United States this week to attend the annual <a href="https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/3189/">news nerd conference known as NICAR</a>, a diverse gathering of reporters, editors and developers (and others) focused on storytelling with data.</p>
<p>I look forward to it like Christmas.</p>

<p>The conference generally has a mix of skills sets and expertise levels, which is evident in the session categories:</p>

<p>There are people here from almost every American state and from numerous countries around the world. My jet lag brain is still working through how to best visualize that, perhaps in a map. I’ll post something soon.</p>
