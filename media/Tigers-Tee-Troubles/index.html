    <p>Tiger Woods <a href="http://www.masters.com/en_US/players/player_8793.html?r=lb">struggled</a> off the tee yesterday at the Masters, a key reason he’s tied for 29th in a tournament in which many picked him as the favorite.</p>
<p>Tiger’s driving accuracy has also contributed to the general decline in his performance since its peak in 2000. He’s looked better this season, though, leading to his first PGA Tour win since 2009 two weeks ago.</p>
<p>This chart shows his driving accuracy over time, according to <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/r/stats/info/xm.html?102">tour statistics</a>:</p>
