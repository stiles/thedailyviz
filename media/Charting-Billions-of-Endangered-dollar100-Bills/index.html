<p>The ubiquitous $100 currency note — the <em>Bill</em>, the <em>C-Note</em>, the <em>Benjamin</em> — might be ready to cash out, at least if a group of influential economists have their way.</p>
<p>In a recent paper, scholars at Harvard University argue that the elimination of the $100 bill, along with other high-value currency notes around the world, could reduce corruption and restrict criminal enterprises.</p>
<p>Their findings even prompted a former U.S. Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers, to suggest that governments should stop printing $50 and $100 notes, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-plot-to-kill-the-100-bill-1455667926">reports</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’d guess the idea of removing existing notes is a step too far. But a moratorium on printing new high-denomination notes would make the world a better place,” Mr. Summers wrote in an item for The Washington Post’s Wonkblog.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the Journal reports, though, the $100 bill isn’t quite spent. About 10 billion of them — roughly $1 trillion in currency — are still circulating through the world economy (though far too few are in my wallet these days).</p>
<p>They’ve been printed at a steady rate during the last 30 years, according to <a href="http://www.moneyfactory.gov/resources/productionannual.html">data</a> released by the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing. And another 1.5 billion <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_currency_orders.htm">have been ordered</a> for the 2016 fiscal year, the agency says.</p>
<p><a href="https://thedailyviz.com/currency/">This chart</a> plots the printing rates of the various U.S. dollar notes since 1980. Note the recent spike in $100 printing during the 2013 fiscal year. That fall the government began issuing a new round of $100 bills with <a href="https://uscurrency.gov/sites/default/files/hundred-face-01.jpg">enhanced security features</a>. The printing fell off again last year to reflect the burst in new paper.</p>
