<p>HuffPost is out with an <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-confidence-in-the-fbi-has-dropped-since-2015_us_5a721bbbe4b09a544b5616a7">interesting poll</a> about the the public’s trust in the FBI, which has been under attack recently for its role in the investigations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump and his supporters have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/us/politics/conservatives-mueller-fbi-republicans-trump.html">particularly tough</a> on the bureau, and it shows in the polling data.</p>
<blockquote><p>A slim 51 percent majority of the public say they have at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, down 12 points since 2015. Most of that change comes from Republicans and independents, among whom the percentage saying they trust the agency dropped by 22 points and 15 points, respectively. Allies of the White House have spent much of January ramping up their attacks against the FBI’s Russia investigation. </p></blockquote>
