    <p><em>The Washington Post</em> has a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/in-dc-a-push-for-better-restaurants-east-of-the-anacostia-river/2012/02/16/gIQAXaE9NR_story.html">story</a> today about the lack of sit-down restaurants across the Anacostia River in neighborhoods that are among the poorest in the city.</p>
<blockquote> <p>For decades, the main arteries east of the Anacostia River have been dominated by carry-out joints and fast-food chains, their menus catering to an African American population that is the city’s most impoverished. In wards 7 and 8, with 140,000 residents, District officials and community leaders say they’re aware of just six restaurants that provide waiter service, including a Denny’s and an IHOP. The dearth of choices fuels the sense among residents that theirs is a forgotten part of Washington.</p> </blockquote>
