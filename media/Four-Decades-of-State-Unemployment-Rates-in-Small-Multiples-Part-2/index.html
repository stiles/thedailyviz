<p>I <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/2016/12/04/charting-the-u-s-unemployment-rates-state-by-state-in-small-multiples/">posted recently</a> about how the state-by-state unemployment rate <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/2016/12/04/charting-the-u-s-unemployment-rates-state-by-state-in-small-multiples/">has changed</a> during my lifetime. The result was a small multiples grid that put the states in context with one another.</p>
<p>Today I’ve created a new version aimed at identifying more precisely how each state has differed from the national unemployment rate during the last four decades. The lines show the percentage point difference — above (worst) or below (better) — from the national rate.</p>
<p>This view allows us easily to identify the most anomalous states in both directions (West Virginia, for example, had quite an unemployment spike during the 1980s; South Dakota, on the other hand, has never been worse than the national rate).</p>
<p>There’s plenty more to explore in this quick remix:</p>
