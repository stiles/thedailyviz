    <p>These <a href="http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/results/states/IA.html">maps</a>, created by <em>The New York Times</em> four years ago to visualize the Republican results, might be interesting for reference as the returns come in tonight.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney, who lost to Mike Huckabee in 2008, carried the eastern and western portions of the state. Will he tonight? Huckabee carried the middle of the state, including Des Moines. Who will take them tonight? Paul won just one county. Will he improve on that total?</p>

<p>This map displays the raw vote total by county. Larger bubbles represent higher margins of victory. Huckabee won Polk County, which contains Des Moines, by 2,700 votes â€” one quarter of his victory margin. Who will win it tonight?</p>
