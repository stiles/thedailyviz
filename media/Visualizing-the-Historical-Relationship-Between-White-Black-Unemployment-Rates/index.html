<p>President Trump was right last month when <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/957603800579297280">he bragged</a> that black unemployment rate was at a historical low. The rate in December was 6.8 percent, the lowest it’s been since 1972 (though it ticked back up nearly a percentage point last month).</p>
<p>But the president’s statement excluded some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/us/politics/factcheck-trump-black-americans-support.html">important context</a> about the historic movement of this rate by race and ethnicity. I’ve tried to explain in these graphics.</p>
<p>First, here are four rates — all groups, black, Hispanic and white — since Ronald Reagan was in office. The early 1980s, as you can see, were pretty rough. Things have gotten better, both in terms of the rate during recessions and recoveries, and all groups have improved together as a pattern since the Great Recession:</p>

<p>Whether you believe a president can have any short-term effect on unemployment or not, a key point is that these rates rise and fall together. They are quite strongly correlated. In about 90 percent of the months since 1980, for example, a relationship existed between movement in the white and black rates. This correlation is slightly less strong under Democratic presidents, for whatever reason:</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Even though the black rate is relatively low today, it has historically been about 2-2.5 times higher than the white rate.</p>
