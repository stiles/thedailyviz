    <p>Despite her big win in New York, trouble looms for Hillary Clinton in the general election, according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hillary-clinton-won-new-york-but-her-image-is-underwater/2016/04/19/d1ff2f3c-0620-11e6-b283-e79d81c63c1b_story.html">new poll</a> that shows her favorable/unfavorable ratings at dangerously low levels among key demographic groups.</p>
<p>Clinton has seen her fair share of bad polls over the years, yet she’s found ways to rebound. The same <a href="https://hilaryparker.com/2013/01/30/hilary-the-most-poisoned-baby-name-in-us-history/">can’t really be said</a> about her first name, however.</p>
<p>Perhaps one measure of her favorability — if so, a cruel one — is the frequency with which American parents have decided to call their daughters “Hillary”. The name peaked historically the year her husband, Bill Clinton, won the White House. It then plummeted dramatically, according to <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-level-data">Social Security card application data</a> released by the federal government.</p>
<p>This chart shows the proportion of parents who picked “Hillary” since 1947, the presidential candidate’s birth year:</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>“Hillary” was most popular in 1992, when about 2,500 girls received the name — roughly .14 percent of those listed in the data that year. Two years later, only about 400 girls received the name, or about .02 percent. (“Hillary”, by the way, made a small but brief comeback in 2008).</p>
<p>The figures in both years seem low, given the size of the country. But remember that Americans get creative with their kids’ names. There were about 1.84 million girls who received Social Security cards in 1992, and their parents picked at least 15,000 different name iterations, from Aaisha to Zykeia. Ashley was most popular with about 38,000 applications (or roughly 2 percent of the listed names).</p>
<p>Perhaps Hillary would be slightly more popular if parents conformed (or could spell). In 1992, for example, a few hundred poor souls got these iterations of Clinton’s name: Hilliary, Hillery, Hillari, Hillarie and Hillaree. Also: <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hilaryhillary.png">Hilary</a>.</p>
<p>My name — Matthew — has taken a roller coaster ride, too. It peaked in 1983, with about 50,000 boys receiving it — roughly 2.8 percent of the 1.8 million boys who received Social Security cards with that birth year. What caused the name’s rise? Perhaps I’ll never know, though my mother picked it not from the New Testament but from a John Denver song.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mom. (At least you spelled it <em>correctly</em>).</p>
