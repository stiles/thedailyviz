<p>Immigration to the United Kingdom has risen sharply in recent years, and it’s <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-immigration-unease-animates-brexit-vote-1466006349">fueling the debate</a> about Britain’s looming “Brexit” vote on whether to leave the European Union.</p>
<p>Many supporters advocating a “leave” vote on June 23 believe it’s best the best way to control Britain’s borders, which under E.U. rules have been opened to workers from other member nations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">Brussels-based union</a> has in recent years expanded to Eastern European nations, and residents from the those countries have flooded the U.K., population 64 million, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo">newly released data</a> shows. That’s stoked fears that the its traditions and values are changing. Others say the influx of outside residents keeps Britain’s economy relatively strong.</p>
<p>The U.K.’s <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo">Office for National Statistics</a> tracks the ebb and flow of people each year. I’ve charted the figures ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>The number of Britons, for example, returning home has remained relatively flat over the years, while the influx of those born elsewhere — both within and outside the union — has outpaced the natives:</p>

<p>Britons are also leaving in greater numbers than those returning to their home countries:</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>That led net migration — the number of all people leaving the country minus those arriving — to reach 330,000 last year, a peak after a particularly shape climb recently. This chart shows the trend over the years:</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>These immigration trends have significantly changed the number (and the nationality) of foreign-born residents in the U.K. This table shows the percentage increase in foreign-born residents from 2004, when Poland joined the E.U., to 2014. Check out Eastern Europe:</p>
