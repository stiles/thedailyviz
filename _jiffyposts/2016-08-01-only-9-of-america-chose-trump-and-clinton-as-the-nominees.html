  _embedly_description: An additional 73 million did not vote in the primaries this
    year, but will most likely vote in the general election. Does not include people
    who voted in caucuses, which have less reliable turnout numbers. A small percentage
    of people vote in primaries but not in general elections, and they are also not
    included.
