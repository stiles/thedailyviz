    of all counties and county-equivalents in the nation – in which fewer than 5 percentage
    points separated Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney, according to
    a new Pew Research Center analysis of county-level voting data. That was the fewest
    closely contested counties since Ronald Reagan’s landslide re-election in 1984."'
