  _embedly_description: Women gravitated toward commitment more than men. Among the
    same-sex marriages, 55 percent involved same-sex women and 45 percent same-sex
    men. Those in same-sex marriages tend to be a little younger than those in straight
    marriages. The average age of same-sex filers is 47, while the average age for
    those in straight couples is 51.
