    - I've been poking around grocery store locations, courtesy of AggData, the past
    few days. There's a grocery store just about everywhere you go in the United States,
    because, well, we gotta eat. They look similar in that they sell produce on one
    side, meat in the back, and snacks and soda on the side opposite the produce.</div>
