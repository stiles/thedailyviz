<a href="https://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/zika-dailyviz.jpg"><img src="https://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/zika-dailyviz.jpg" alt="zika-dailyviz" width="800" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2946"></a></p>
<p>Last winter, health officials began to worry seriously about an outbreak of the Zika-related illness in the United States. I wondered, how many people could be affected as habitats for <em>aedes aegypti</em> — the mosquito thought to carry the virus — as temperatures warmed? </p>
<p>I obtained a mosquito habitat geography file from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. I then used a spatial query to determine how many Americans counties were within that footprint — and, of course, the population and demographics of those locations. The <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/2016/02/24/mapping-mosquitoes/">result</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The mosquitoes’ habitat may seem small geographically compared the country as a whole, but it does includes about one in five American counties. They are home to roughly 80 million people, according to a Daily Viz analysis of data released by the mapping company Esri and the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>The rough map below shows the species’ habitat (shaded in pink) and its respective counties’ population density (red dots represent 50,000 residents). The area includes roughly 29 million households — some of which, of course, will include pregnant women this summer.</p></blockquote>
