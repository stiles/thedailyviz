<p>South Korea's snap presidential election — required after the impeachment and removal of Park Geun-hye — is next month. That got me thinking about how the vote might play out geographically. </p>
<p>To understand South Korea's regional politics a little better, I created maps showing the two top contenders in the presidential vote from 2012. The candidates were Park, a conservative who won with 51 percent of the vote nationally, and Moon Jae-in, a liberal who lost but is the frontrunner this time around. </p>
<p>Thematic maps of the Park-Moon contest — perhaps now familiar to observers of South Korean politics — show this clear regionalism, according to <a href="http://www.nec.go.kr/engvote_2013/main/main.jsp">data</a> from the National Election Commission.</p>
<p>In this map, we see Park’s share of the vote, broken down by municipal subdivisions in each province and major city, with darker red shades representing more voter support:</p>

<p>The opposite, of course, is true for Moon. Here darker blue shades represent the areas where his campaign was strongest in that election:</p>
<p>[pym src="https://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/south-korea-election-choropleth-moon-20170420/child.html"]</p>
<p>The maps, obviously, show a wide variance of support for either candidate, depending on the region, as is evident in the broad color scale, which was devised using a common statistical data clustering method known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization">Jenks</a>.</p>
<p>The vote for Park and Moon, however, was much closer in Seoul. Neither candidate received less than 40 percent of the vote in any district. &lt;strong&gt;Note that the scale for the maps of Seoul, below, also made with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization">Jenks</a>, is different than those depicting the national vote. &lt;/strong&gt;</p>
<p>Park was strongest south of the Han River, particularly in Gangnam-gu, where she received just over 60 percent of the vote:</p>

<p>And Moon’s strongest district was Gwanak-gu, where he received just under 60 percent:</p>
