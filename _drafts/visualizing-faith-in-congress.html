<p>Much has been made in recent days about the changing demographics in the U.S. House — especially on the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-have-a-more-diverse-slate-of-new-house-members-than-republicans/">Democratic side</a>. Some examples from the in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/14/congress-diversity-democrats-republicans-photo">the Guardian</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In contrast, Democrats celebrated numerous historic firsts on election night. Among them, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became America’s youngest congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar became the first Muslim congresswomen, and Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland became the first Native American congresswomen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pew Research Center has maintain a detailed accounting of the members of Congress, by chamber, party and religious affiliation. Its <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2019/01/03/faith-on-the-hill-116/">new report</a> shows some differences between the parties, including on religion, but the two partisan blocs aren't that much different that they've been in recent congressional terms. </p>
<p>As the report notes, Christians are over represented in Congress — in both parties, but especially on the Republican side. About 88 of members told Pew they are Christians, while only about 71 percent of Americans said that. </p>
<p>Here's how the two parties differ. The GOP members are almost all Christian:<br />

<p>Here you can see how the chamber has gradually shifted from a strong Protestant minority over time. Catholics are a larger proportion now because of the increase in the numbers of Hispanic members on the Democratic side.<br />
