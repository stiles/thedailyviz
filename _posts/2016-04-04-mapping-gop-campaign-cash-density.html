<p>The GOP presidential candidates collectively have raised more than $300 million in this election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission <a href="http://fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do">data</a>. Here's a quick look at <em>where</em> several of those candidates — Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump — collected the money.</p>
<p>Each dot on the maps (<strong>see update below</strong>) below represents at least $5,000 raised by zip code. The dots in each place are assigned randomly within the zip code boundaries, creating a density map (think <a href="https://www.google.co.kr/search?q=Verizon+vs.+AT%26T+map&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtotnElfTLAhUC4aYKHVa9DJIQ_AUIBygB&amp;biw=1279&amp;bih=662">Verizon vs. AT&amp;T</a>) for campaign donations* through Feb. 29.</p>
<p>Here's a (crowded) map with all the candidates. The dots were layered alphabetically, a method that unfortunately obscures some candidates at this scale, depending on the geography. Still regional differences are evident:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_all.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1908"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1908 size-large" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_all-1024x835.png" alt="zips_gop_contribs_all" width="840" height="685"></a></p>
<p><strong>JEB BUSH</strong></p>
<p>The former Florida governor raised large amounts of money, of course, from his home state, but also — as the perceived frontrunner for a time — from major population centers:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_bush_red.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1949"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1949 size-large" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_bush_red-1024x791.png" alt="zips_gop_contribs_bush_red" width="840" height="649"></a></p>
<p><strong>BEN CARSON</strong></p>
<p>Carson raised a ton of money for someone who received relatively little love once voters started casting their ballots. His map shows he raised more from small locations throughout the country, not just the major population centers:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_carson_red.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1948"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1948 size-large" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_carson_red-1024x791.png" alt="zips_gop_contribs_carson_red" width="840" height="649"></a></p>
<p><strong>CHRIS CHRISTIE</strong></p>
<p>The New Jersey governor, understandably, raised a large proportion of his money from his home region:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_christie_red.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1947"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1947 size-large" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_christie_red-1024x791.png" alt="zips_gop_contribs_christie_red" width="840" height="649"></a></p>
<p><strong>TED CRUZ</strong></p>
<p>The Texas senator raised money from all over the country, but he clearly has a financial base in Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and Houston — the major population centers in his home state.</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_cruz_red.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1946"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1946 size-large" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_cruz_red-1024x791.png" alt="zips_gop_contribs_cruz_red" width="840" height="649"></a></p>
<p><strong>JOHN KASICH</strong></p>
<p>Like Christie, the Ohio governor tapped his donor base at home:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_kasich_red.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1945"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1945 size-large" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_kasich_red-1024x791.png" alt="zips_gop_contribs_kasich_red" width="840" height="649"></a></p>
<p><strong>MARCO RUBIO</strong></p>
<p>The Florida senator's map looks much like that of his frenemy, Bush:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_rubio_red.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1944"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1944 size-large" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_rubio_red-1024x791.png" alt="zips_gop_contribs_rubio_red" width="840" height="649"></a></p>
<p><strong>DONALD TRUMP</strong></p>
<p>The billionaire business man, who has relied largely on personal funds for his campaign, has raised very little money in checks larger than $200, as reflected in his map:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_trump_red.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1950"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1950 size-large" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/zips_gop_contribs_trump_red-1024x791.png" alt="zips_gop_contribs_trump_red" width="840" height="649"></a></p>
<p>* <em>To keep the analysis consistent for all campaigns, the maps were created with a data set that excluded individual donations of less than $200. The data include only donations to the candidates' campaign committees, not other political committees supporting them.</em></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (9:20 p.m. EST):</strong> Based on David's suggestion in the comments, I've changed the dot color in the individual maps so it's consistent.
