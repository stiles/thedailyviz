<p>More <a href="http://www.advisory.com/Daily-Briefing/2012/01/25/SOTU" target="_blank">analysis</a> from the speech from The Advisory Board Company: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obama’s speech included just 44 words on health reform, far fewer than in his previous addresses. He said that the makeup of the overhaul—which he noted relies on a “reformed private market, not a government program”—is a sign that he is willing to work with Republicans.</p>
