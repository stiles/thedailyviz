<p>Hillary Clinton's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-south-carolina-black-voters/470646/">efforts</a> to win over minority voters have paid off significantly in the Democratic primaries. Many of these voters simply <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/why-black-voters-dont-feel-the-bern-213707">aren't feeling the Bern</a>, according to voting results and demographics data from the <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/tag/census/">U.S. Census Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>Since January, Clinton and her main rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have faced off in 26 states, pulling about 15 million votes from 1,900 counties and county equivalents. (Votes in two states, Kansas and Minnesota, were calculated at the congressional district level).</p>
<p>Roughly 250 of the counties contested in the Democratic race are <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/2016/03/16/where-anglos-are-the-minority/">majority minority</a>, meaning non-Hispanic whites there represent less than half the population. The majority in those places is as follows: Blacks (91 counties), Hispanics (64 counties) and Native Americans/Alaska natives (1 county). Another 93 counties have no ethnic or racial majority, making them quite diverse compared to much of America.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton won all but seven of these majority minority counties. </strong></p>
<p>To understand this phenomenon, it's useful to take a look at her vote share on a map (inspired by The New York Times' lovely interactive version <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/national-results-map">here</a>). She's dominated the Deep South and Texas, places with high proportions of black and Hispanic voters, respectively:</p>

<p>Sanders' map also clearly shows Clinton's strength, except for a few places (remember Kansas and Minnesota's maps would look different had votes been counted at the county level) outside the South and in New England, his home turf:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/primary_results_dems_sanders.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1794"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-1794" title="" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/primary_results_dems_sanders-620x478.png" alt="primary_results_dems_sanders" width="610"></a></p>
<p>Here's a map showing all 249 majority minority counties in the Democratic race thus far on top of Clinton's vote share. As I mentioned, Sanders only won seven of them (and only one with a population greater than 10,000): </p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/primary_results_dems_clinton_mm-3.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1818"><img src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/primary_results_dems_clinton_mm-3-620x472.png" alt="primary_results_dems_clinton_mm" title="" width="610" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-1818"></a></p>
<p>Clinton's dominance is particularly evident among black voters specifically. Of all the counties in the race, not just those that are majority minority, about 380 have at least a 25-percent black population. Clinton, somehow, won them all, edging Sanders by 1.5 million votes:</p>
<p><a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/primary_results_dems_clinton_black-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1819"><img src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/primary_results_dems_clinton_black-1-620x479.png" alt="primary_results_dems_clinton_black" title="" width="610" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-1819"></a></p>
<p>Of course, none of this is a surprise. Black voters in <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/139880/election-polls-presidential-vote-groups.aspx">overwhelmingly</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/when-did-black-americans-start-voting-so-heavily-democratic/">side with the Democrats</a>, and Clinton is the Democratic front runner. But it's interesting, I suppose, that Sanders hasn't done better.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
