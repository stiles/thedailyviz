<p>Last week I posted a <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/2017/11/25/visualizing-north-korean-provocations-a-timeline/">visual timeline</a> highlighting nuclear, missile and other "provocations" by the North Korean regime since 2006. The data show a clear escalation, especially in missile tests, since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un">Kim Jong Un</a> took power in late 2011. </p>
<p>It's been more than 70 days, though, since the last provocation. The most-recent incident was the firing of an intermediate-range ballistic missile — most likely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwasong-12">Hwasong-12</a> — over Japanese territory into the Pacific Ocean. It was the latest in a flurry of tests this year. </p>
<p>Some, though, have been heartened by this slowdown in recent weeks, suggesting that tensions between the United States and North Korea might be cooling. </p>
<p>What actually might be happening, however, is that the temperature is cooling in Pyongyang, as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/adam-taylor/?utm_term=.aa529b90d7c1">Adam Taylor</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/27/russia-is-encouraged-by-a-lull-in-north-korean-weapon-tests-it-could-end-up-disappointed/?utm_term=.e817a719a92a">noted</a> in The Washington Post today.</p>
<p>Here's an updated version of the timeline, showing just the Kim Jong Un era: </p>

<p>And this simple bar chart, which categorizes provocation dates into common seasonal quarters, shows that Pyongyang's efforts seem to <em>cool</em>, if you will, late in the year under Kim's leadership: </p>
