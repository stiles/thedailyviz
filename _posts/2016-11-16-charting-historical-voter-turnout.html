<p>As FiveThirtyEight <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/no-voter-turnout-wasnt-way-down-from-2012/">notes</a>, turnout in the 2016 presidential election isn't dramatically lower than it was four years ago, according to the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2016g">latest estimates</a>. And with many mail-in and provision ballots still being counted, the 2016 turnout rate could still change: </p>
<blockquote><p>Approximately 58.1 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in last week’s presidential election, according to <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2016g" target="_blank">the latest estimates</a> from Michael McDonald, associate professor at the University of Florida, who gathers data at the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/">U.S. Elections Project</a>. That’s down only slightly from 2012, when turnout was <a href="http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present">58.6 percent,</a> and well above 2000’s rate of 54.2 percent. Turnout may end up being higher than in any presidential election year between 1972 and 2000....</p>
<p>We won’t have final turnout numbers for weeks or months because some states are still counting ballots; millions remain uncounted. That means estimates based solely on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/htmlview?sle=true#gid=19">votes counted so far</a> will understate turnout — though already <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/htmlview?sle=true#gid=19">more presidential votes</a> have been counted this year than in 2012 (contrary to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/14/seven-reasons-why-hillary-clinton-lost-and-donald-trump-won.html">reports</a> that fewer voters turned out this year). In the meantime, most news organizations rely on estimates from McDonald.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's a quick look at historic turnout in both midterm and general elections, according to <a href="http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present">estimates</a> compiled by McDonald: </p>
