<p>Last night <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III" target="_blank">Robert Griffin III</a> became the first Baylor football player to win the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Heisman_Trophy_winners" target="_blank">Heisman Trophy</a>, the college game’s highest honor. Griiffin was the 76th player to receive the award — and the 28th quarterback — since the tradition began in 1936.</p>
<p>The winner is selected from ballots cast by hundreds of sports journalists, and past honorees. Each votes for three players, and ranks them on scale from first place (three points) to third place (one point). The higher the points received by a player, the more unanimous his selection as the winner. </p>
<p>Griffin received 1,687 points, slightly above the average winner over the years. Here’s how players have compared since the start (colored in Baylor green): </p>
