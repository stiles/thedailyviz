<p>My wife Elise gave birth to a <a href="http://www.heyelise.com/2012/09/24/pretty-young-thing/" target="_blank">baby girl</a> on Saturday, meaning it's time for me to take a guilt-free vacation from the blog, which I've been neglecting already in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here's a parting viz, showing the interval between her contractions as we labored from home. They began around 4:30 a.m. on Saturday, coming and going erratically until the late afternoon. </p>
<p>At that point the contractions came every three minutes, our baseline for going to the hospital (that's also when we stopped collecting data, which admittedly aren't perfect because we missed a few contractions along the way). Baby Eva came three hours later.</p>

<p>See you soon...</p>
