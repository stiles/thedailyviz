<p>Stephen Colbert this week used word clouds — visual representations of word frequencies in selected blocks of text — to tell a story about his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/">political action committee</a>.</p>
<p>Colbert recently asked supporters to submit suggestions for the PAC’s mission, and he wanted to visualize their responses for his television audience.</p>
<p>This version shows the most popular words in all the responses: </p>
<p><img src="http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/images/unweighted_wordcloud.jpg" width="500"></p>
<p>Then, Colbert (or presumably someone on his staff) weighted the cases to represent only responses by donors who gave at least $1. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/images/weighted_wordcloud.jpg" width="500"></p>
<p>The second version represents the responses Colbert “heard,” I suppose making a point about the fact that corporate spending is now considered political speech.</p>
<p>Genius. Here’s the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/394776/august-16-2011/colbert-super-pac---persuadulux-6000">full sketch</a>. </p>
