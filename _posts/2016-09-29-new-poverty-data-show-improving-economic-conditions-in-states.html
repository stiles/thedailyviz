<p>Economic conditions continue to improve in America's states, with many showing significant declines in their poverty rates, according to <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/acsbr15-01.pdf">new survey data</a> released recently by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>About 14.7 percent of the American population had incomes last year that were below their respective poverty levels, which vary depending on household size — a significant decline from 2014. <!--more--></p>
<p>Data in the states reflect that improvement. First, here's how the states compared last year. New Hampshire had the lowest rate (8.2%), and Mississippi had the highest rate (22%):  </p>

<p>And here's how the poverty rate changed in each state. As I mentioned, at least 23 states — across all regions of the country — saw significant declines in their respective rates (those state name labels are italicized). </p>
<p>Four states technically saw slightly increased poverty rates, according to the survey results, but they were not considered statistically significant changes (each state has a respective margin of error) by the bureau. Still, they are shaded in orange here to highlight them:</p>
