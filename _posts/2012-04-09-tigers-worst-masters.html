<p>The <em>Associated Press</em> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/woods-matches-worst-4-round-score-masters-203651292--golf.html" target="_blank">captures</a> the performance well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tiger Woods arrived at Augusta National as a favorite to win his fifth green jacket. Instead, he left with his worst score as a pro.</p></blockquote>
<p>This chart, made with <a href="http://www.augusta.com/masters/players/bios/Tiger_Woods.shtml" target="_blank">data from the <em>Augusta Chronicle</em></a>, shows his four-round average scores at the Masters since he turned pro in 1997.

<p>It should be noted that weather conditions vary each year. Tiger finished second in 2007 when low temperatures and wind made scoring difficult, for example. Still, itâ€™s a general indicator of performance. Another measure is the leader board position: Tiger finished 41st this year, by far his worst effort.</body></html></p>
