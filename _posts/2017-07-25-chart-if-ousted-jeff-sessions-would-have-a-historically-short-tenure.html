<p>If President Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-leaves-sessions-twisting-in-the-wind-while-berating-him-publicly/2017/07/24/ce3bf142-708b-11e7-9eac-d56bd5568db8_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_sessions-9p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.7f4fdf801111">decides after all to replace</a> Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was approved just 166 days ago, the former Alabama senator would have one of the shortest tenures in history. </p>
<p>More than 80 Americans have been the nation's top law enforcement officer as cabinet members, rather than acting placeholders. That list includes 39 Republicans and 30 Democrats. <em>Another 13 attorneys general from other parties (Whig, Federalist, etc.) have also held the office</em>. </p>

<p>Only two others have served shorter terms. One, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Richardson">Elliot Richardson</a>, resigned in protest while serving under Richard Nixon during Watergate. The other, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a>, took office in the tumultuous months before Abraham Lincoln became president.</p>
<p>Here's the list, sorted from longest-to-shortest tenure: </p>
