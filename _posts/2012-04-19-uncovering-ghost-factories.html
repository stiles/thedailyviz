<p>USA Today has a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-19/smelting-lead-contamination-government-failure/54399578/1" target="_blank">terrific package</a> today about neighborhoods across the country that could have dangerous levels of lead contamination from old factories:</p>

A 14-month USA TODAY investigation has found that the EPA and state regulators left thousands of families and children in harm's way, doing little to assess the danger around many of the more than 400 potential lead smelter locations on a list compiled by a researcher from old industry directories and given to the EPA in 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>Included is an interactive map with information about these locations:</p>
