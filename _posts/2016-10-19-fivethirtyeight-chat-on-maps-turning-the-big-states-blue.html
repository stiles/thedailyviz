<p>The folks at FiveThirtyEight had a fun data visualization discussion during their <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-clinton-play-for-an-electoral-college-landslide/">regular election chat</a> this week, about whether Hillary Clinton should focus on ensuring victory next month or spending more money in "red" states to expand her Electoral College map. </p>
<p>Nate Silver chimes in by alluding to the <a href="http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/">classic discussion</a> about how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">choropleth maps</a> of the United States in a <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/2016/06/13/lets-tesstellate-the-electoral-college-in-tile-grid-maps-1980-2012/">political context can distort a story</a>. That's because geographically large but sparsely populated western states skew the picture. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>harry:</strong> People look to the map to understand how big the victory was. We have a winner-take-all system.</p>
<p><strong>micah:</strong> Yeah, if the map everyone sees on Nov. 9 is covered in blue, doesn’t that make a difference?</p>
<p><strong>clare.malone:</strong> I think it’s a reasonable goal for them to want to/try to win at least one unexpected state. A spot of blue in a sea of red can be a striking visual that people walk away with.</p>
<p><strong>natesilver:</strong> So should they aim for states that are physically larger because they’re more impressive on the map?</p>
<p><strong>clare.malone:</strong> Hah, yes.</p>
<p><strong>natesilver:</strong> So Alaska then?</p>
<p><strong>clare.malone:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>natesilver:</strong> Or not Alaska because it gets shrunken down?</p>
<p><strong>harry:</strong> Is this a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection">Mercator</a> problem? I don’t know maps.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good stuff. </p>
<p>Of course, she could always try to win like Raegan did in 1984 — and then it won't matter how you visualize it: </p>
