<p>Last fall I posted some <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/2012/11/13/charting-major-league-baseball-day-to-day-standings-with-tufte-inspired-sparklines/">Tufte-inspired sparkline</a> charts to visualize how Major League Baseball teams fared during the 2012 season. </p>
<p>I've created <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/epl/">something similar</a> for clubs in the English Premier League, where the season is winding down with Manchester United holding a strong lead in points. <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/epl/" target="_blank">This chart</a> shows how they've done it — by winning, not just drawing, with their opponents. United has 21 wins so far, while their cross-town rivals — Manchester City — have just 15.</p>
<p>Matches that end in draws are still important to a club's success in the league, but I wanted to see their performance in wins and losses. The lines on the <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/epl/">chart</a> represent the total number of games over .500 for all 20 clubs.
