<p>As a kid growing up in Tallahassee, I both cherished and dreaded the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_%E2%80%93_Florida_State_rivalry">Florida State vs. Florida rivalry</a>. As a 'Noles fan, the game too often ended in defeat, occasionally dashing my team's national title hopes. </p>
<p>But I'll always remember the best game of the rivalry — the 1994 "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Choke_at_Doak">Choke at Doke</a>" — in which the Gators gave up a 31-3 lead in the fourth quarter, settling for a 31-31 tie. (FSU won the "fifth quarter" rematch that season at the Sugar Bowl).</p>
<p>This chart shows the point differential between the two teams since 1958. You can see that FSU dominated the rivalry in the 1990s. Florida largely owned the 2000s. </p>

<p>We'll see what happens today. Go 'Noles!</p>
