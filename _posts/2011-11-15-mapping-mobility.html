<p>The U.S. Census Bureau today released a <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acsbr10-07.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on geographic mobility based on data from the American Community Survey: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The comparison of data on state of residence in 2010 to data on state and region of birth reflects the cumulative effect of long-term patterns of migration. Fifty-nine percent of people in the United States were born in their state of residence. However, there is significant geographic variation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seventy percent of people in the Midwest, for example, live in the same state as their birth. While just under half the people in the West remained in their birth states. The West, by the way, has the highest proportion of foreign-born residents: 20 percent, according to the report.</p>
