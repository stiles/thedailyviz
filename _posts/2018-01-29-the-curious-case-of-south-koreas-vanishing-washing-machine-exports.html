title: The Curious Case of South Korea's Vanishing Washing Machine Exports

<p>The Trump administration last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/business/trump-tariffs-washing-machines-solar-panels.html">announced</a> that it planned to impose higher fees, known as tariffs, to countries that export washing machines and solar panels the United States.</p>
<p>The tariffs, prompted by complaints from American companies who feel disadvantaged by global trade, were applied across the world — even though they seem primarily aimed at two nations who dominate the market: China and South Korea. </p>
<p>That's in part because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/trump-china-tariffs-trade.html">both countries have moved their manufacturing</a> around to avoid such duties. In South Korea's case, the change in strategy by companies like LG and Samsung seems remarkably obvious in trade data — on washing machines, in particular. </p>
<p>A bit of background: The <a href="https://usatrade.census.gov/">U.S. Census Bureau</a> keeps detailed data on specific product exports, by country, to the United States. The data reflect the total export value by year and national origin — where the ships came from, essentially — not by companies' home countries. <em>So Samsung products made in China and exported from China look like Chinese exports.</em> </p>
<p>This graphic shows one possible scenario for how the strategy played out. Washing machine exports from South Korea to the United States dropped dramatically, for example, after a complaint filed in late 2011 by Whirlpool, an American manufacturer. A year later, exports from China increased significantly (and have since fallen, perhaps reflecting other shifts in manufacturing locations, such as Southeast Asia, Mexico and/or the United States itself). </p>
<p>The Times' story noted the South Korean companies' concerns:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung and LG described Whirlpool’s case as a protectionist grab designed to shut out products that American consumers find more attractive, and argued that such restrictions on their products would hurt consumers by raising prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>The export change appears to be because South Korean washing machine companies <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Press/fs/201%20Cases%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">moved their operations</a> to China during 2013 — and later the the United States — perhaps in an effort to avoid the complaints or looming tariffs. <em>Or because the change was good business for the companies.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, the data seems pretty obvious:</p>
