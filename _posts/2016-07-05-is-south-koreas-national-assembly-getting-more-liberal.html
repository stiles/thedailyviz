<p>Members of South Korea's legislative branch, known as the National Assembly, recently took a poll to determine where they land on the ideological spectrum. The group as a whole <a href="http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3020845&amp;cloc=joongangdaily|home|top">appears to be getting more liberal</a>, according to an analysis of the results.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by the Korea <em>JoongAng Daily</em> and the Korean Political Science Association, gave lawmakers a 15-question ideological test. The questions focused on the Korean alliance with the United States, relations with North Korea, corporate reform, welfare and gay marriage, among other topics.  </p>
<p>Each lawmaker scored on a scale from 0 (liberal) to 10 (conservative). According to <a href="http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3020845&amp;cloc=joongangdaily|home|top">JoongAng Daily</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Scores below 4 are considered liberals. Scores between 4 and 6 are considered moderates while scores higher than 6 are seen as conservatives. </p>
<p>The outcome of the poll shows an average score for the lawmakers of 3.9, 0.7 points lower, or more left-leaning, than the last joint survey conducted in the early days of the 19th National Assembly four years ago....</p>
<p>The outcome showed that the 20th Assembly, though 83 lawmakers weren’t polled, has moved to the left on the ideological spectrum in what some see as a response to growing calls from the public to rein in widening economic inequality. </p></blockquote>
<p>A sample of the South Korean public also took the poll. The respondents were moderate, scoring 5 on average — more conservative than the average score for lawmakers: 3.9. The public is more liberal than the Saenuri party and more conservative than the Minjoo, the ideologically differing parties that control the assembly. </p>
<p>I remixed the newspaper's <a href="http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3020845&amp;cloc=joongangdaily|home|top">graphic</a> a bit, choosing a dot chart over a line chart. The result: </p>
