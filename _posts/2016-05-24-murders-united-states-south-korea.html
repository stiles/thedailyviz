This post is part of an occasional series profiling the peninsula’s demographics and politics.</em></p>
<p>Among the many benefits of living in South Korea is its relative safety. Crime, it seems, is low — even in Seoul.</p>
<p>But a particularly heinous crime recently — the <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160522000287">slaying of a young woman</a> in Seoul's trendy Gangnam district — has rocked the country and got me thinking again about crime here.</p>
<p>How common, for example, is murder?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>More common than I thought, it turns out. There were more than 900 murders in South Korea during 2014, the <a href="http://kosis.kr/eng/statisticsList/statisticsList_01List.jsp?vwcd=MT_ETITLE&amp;parmTabId=M_01_01#SubCont">most recent data available</a> from the Korean Statistical Information Service.</p>
<p>Compare that with about 14,000 murder cases during the same year in the United States, which obviously has a much larger population. This chart shows the murder rate in both countries per 100,000 population (with a line for Seoul, too).</p>
<p>Despite the high-profile recent case in Seoul, murder remains much less common here.</body></html></p>
