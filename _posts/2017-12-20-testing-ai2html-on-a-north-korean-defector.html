<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-north-korea-defector-20171121-story.html">wrote</a> about the daring defection — and eventual rescue — of a North Korean soldier who barreled across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone">Demilitarized Zone</a> in a truck and then ran as fellow troops fired on him. The story centers on a dramatic video of the ordeal released by United Nations command.  </p>
<blockquote><p>The video, shot the afternoon of Nov. 13, shows the soldier speeding down a road toward the Joint Security Area, a border outpost that’s been the site of military skirmishes and diplomatic talks between the Koreas, still technically at war, and the U.S.</p>
<p>The soldier can be seen driving in a green military-style vehicle past a North Korean checkpoint before wheeling past a monument inside the area, where soldiers from both sides of the conflict are posted in relatively close proximity. The footage is a series of videos taken from different cameras at different angle.</p></blockquote>
<p>The video fascinated me, but I found myself wanting someone to explain the sequences more clearly, so I started crafting a graphic in my free time to annotate the defector's journey. I tried this using the <a href="http://ai2html.org/">ai2html</a> tools created by <em>The New York Times</em> that are built into <a href="https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics">NPR's dailygraphics rig</a>. After a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcqkBKMFREM/?taken-by=mattstiles">visit</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcojCuGF6wR/?taken-by=mattstiles">the location</a> with United States forces last week, I'm confident the graphic is accurate. I'm less confident, unfortunately, in its storytelling, design or technical merit. </p>
<p>Oh, well. Your first try with a new tool is never perfect — especially when this work is just a hobby. </p>
<p>Try it on desktop, tablet and mobile — and let me know if you have thoughts. </p>
