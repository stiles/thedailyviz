<p>At work we developed an <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/2011-budget-puzzle/" target="_blank">app</a> that allows readers to make choices in an effort to close the state’s $27 billion shortfall. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Texas lawmakers have six weeks left in the regular session, and their struggle with the state’s tight budget is expected to take up much of that time. It could even push them into a special session this summer if they can’t reconcile differences between the House and Senate over these final weeks. It’s a hard job, and perhaps the best way to show you that is to hand you some of the numbers —the programs that might be cut, the taxes that might be raised — and let you make some choices as to how the $27 billion budget shortfall should be closed (you can make comments on the app, and on the budget, here). With a tip of the hat to The New York Times — which inspired us with its federal budget solver — and the Houston Chronicle — our partner in this — we invite you to roll up your sleeves, put on your green eyeshade, and get to work on the shortfall.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/2011-budget-puzzle/" target="_blank">app</a> includes a visualization that changes as readers make choices. </p>
