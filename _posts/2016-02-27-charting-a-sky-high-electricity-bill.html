<p>What of the biggest surprises about moving to Seoul, South Korea — aside from the impenetrable language and other cultural adjustments — was the pricey cost of electricity. </p>
<p>The monthly power bills in our high-rise apartment, which doesn't have western-style central air conditioning, have been shockingly expensive — and not just in the summer months. </p>
<p>In the past year the bills have totaled nearly 8 million won, or about $6,500, for power. The building also adds on a host of fees, from common-area electricity charges to trash collection. Those have totaled an additional 5 million won, or $4,000. Ouch.</p>
<p>Seoul is <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/2015/03/18/charting-the-temperate-weather-in-seoul/">relatively mild during the summer, much like Washington, D.C.</a>, but it still gets sticky from June through August. So we ran the ceiling air units in each room a lot. Way too much, apparently.</p>
<p>Here's a chart for the energy portion of bill, which spiked markedly as summer temperatures last year began to rise.</p>
