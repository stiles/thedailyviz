<p>No president since FDR has been re-elected with the unemployment rate above 7.2 percent, as The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/business/economy/02jobs.html" target="_blank">notes</a> this morning:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This interactive line chart, made with Google’s <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/directory" target="_blank">Public Data Explorer</a>, visualizes the seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate since 1948. The rate peaked in 1982 at 10.8 percent. The lowest rate came in 1953: 2.5%. </p></p>
