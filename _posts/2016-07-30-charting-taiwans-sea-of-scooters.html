<p><em>I'm in Taiwan this month to study Mandarin. During breaks, I'll be posting occasionally about the island nation's demographics, politics and (sticky) weather. </em></p>
<p>One of the first things you'll notice about the streets of Taiwan — other than the excellent food, sweet people and formidable humidity, of course — is the constant buzz of scooters. They are everywhere — and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P19qFzqBKGs">loud</a> and perhaps a little <a href="https://taiwanease.com/tw/forums/topic7183.html">unsafe</a>. </p>
<p>That's true even in Taipei, the capitol region, which has a world-class subway system and yet about <a href="http://w2.dbas.taipei.gov.tw/NEWS_WEEKLY/express/English/E21.pdf#a">1 million motorcycles</a> on the roads (as opposed to roughly 800,000 cars and trucks). </p>
<p>It turns out there's a proportionally startling number of <em>motorcycles</em>, as the government classifies them, on the roads across this country: More than 13 million in nation of just 23 million. </p>
<p>Most homes have them, for example:<br />
<div class="pym-container" data-pym-src="https://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/taiwan-appliances-20160719/child.html"></div></p>
<p>And there are nearly twice as many motorcycles on the roads than cars and trucks, according to the government:<br />
<div class="pym-container" data-pym-src="https://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/taiwan-motorcycles-rate-20160719/child.html"></div></p>
<p>Though the rate of motorcycles per 1,000 population is declining:<br />
