<p>Earlier this week I <a href="https://thedailyviz.com/2016/08/09/are-people-in-colder-countries-taller/">posted</a> two scatterplots examining the relationship between a country's average temperature and its male residents' average height. The data show some correlation, but there probably are several of other factors affecting height as well.</p>
<p>The earlier plots shaded the country dots by income and region, allowing more context about the groupings of countries (hint: Europe is colder and taller). </p>
<p>This next version, however, proportionally sizes the dots by population, adding another layer of context (or perhaps unnecessary complexity). <!--more--></p>
<p><em>The colors still represent income as categorized by the World Health Organization</em>:  </p>
