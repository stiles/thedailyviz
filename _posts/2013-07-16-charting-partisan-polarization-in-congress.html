<p>The Fix today <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/07/15/how-the-house-works-or-doesnt-explained-in-1-chart/">has a post</a> about the newly released digital version of <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/07/vital-statistics-congress-mann-ornstein">Vital Statistics on Congress</a>, a partnership between between a few think tanks that contains reams of enlightening data about the institution. </p>
<p>Among the more interesting examples is a table showing the partisan polarization over the years. Chris Cillizza's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/07/15/how-the-house-works-or-doesnt-explained-in-1-chart/">take</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>There is, really, only one thing you need to understand if you want to see why Congress doesnâ€™t do much of anything these days. And that one thing is this: We are living in a time of historic polarization between the two parties.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's clear from the chart in the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/07/vital-statistics-congress-mann-ornstein">report</a> that the parties are as far apart as they've been in the modern era: </p>
