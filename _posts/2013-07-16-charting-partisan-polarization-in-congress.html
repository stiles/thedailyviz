<p>The Fix today <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/07/15/how-the-house-works-or-doesnt-explained-in-1-chart/">has a post</a> about the newly released digital version of <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/07/vital-statistics-congress-mann-ornstein">Vital Statistics on Congress</a>, a partnership between between a few think tanks that contains reams of enlightening data about the institution. </p>
