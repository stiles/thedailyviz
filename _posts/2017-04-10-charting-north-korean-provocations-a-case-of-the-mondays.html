title: Charting North Korean Provocations. A Case of 'The Mondays'?

<p>As a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/search/dispatcher.front?Query=Matt+Stiles&amp;target=all&amp;spell=on">newspaper reporter</a> living in South Korea, I'm always aware that a "provocation" by our friends in the North — a missile launch, a nuclear test, or some other incident — could occur on any day. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-north-korea-projectile-20170211-story.html">recent missile launch</a> came on a Sunday morning, for example, disrupting our family plans. (That's part of the job, of course).</p>
<p>But which days have been more likely for provocations, I wondered? Thanks to a handy <a href="http://beyondparallel.csis.org/database/">database</a> from the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, we now know. </p>
<p>Since 2001, North Korean leaders seem to prefer ... Mondays? </p>
<p>The trend is clear in the data: Compared with any other day, provocations have been twice as common on the first work day of the week. </p>

<p>The data also reveal some interesting tidbits about the North's provocations. Thanks to a recent surge in missile tests, the number of provocations has increased substantially under the new leader, Kim Jong Un, who took power in late December 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il: </p>

<p>The Center categorizes the provocations by type, too (though I broke our "exchange of fire" incidents from "Other" in the data): </p>
<p><div class="pym-container" data-pym-src="https://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/north-korea-provocation-type-20170409/child.html"></div></p>
<p>And here you can see the interest in missile tests. Roughly half of all provocations since 2001 have been missile launches or tests (again, propelled in part by Kim Jong Un's recent interest): </p>
