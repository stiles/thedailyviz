<p>Despite all the controversy attached to his presidency, Donald Trump has managed to retain a relatively consistent approval rating in the last two years — especially when compared to predecessors in the modern era.</p>
<p>The president's approval rating <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2019/03/04/ip-trump-approval.cnn">has climbed some</a> in recent weeks after a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings">significant decline in January</a>, reverting to around the average during the last two years. </p>
<p>Perhaps it's the tribalism in American politics or the fragmented news ecosystem or the president's skills as a communicator — but, for some reason, Trump hasn't experienced the wide fluctuations of his predecessors. </p>
<p><em>He also, of course, remains historically unpopular. </em></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx">Gallup</a>, the president's rating changes have stayed within a 14 percentage point range. </p>
<p>Other presidents — even those who only served one term — have experienced wider swings in their popularity over time. The late George H.W. Bush, for example, saw his popularity drop from 89% in February 1991 to 29% the following summer, a massive change. </p>
