<p>I've just finished watching ESPN's <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/05/espns-oj-documentary-is-a-masterpiece.html">fabulous</a> <em>O.J.: Made in America</em>, a five-part documentary about the Hall of Fame football player.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the process of digesting this latest — and, perhaps, best — telling of O.J.'s story, I scoured Wikipedia for details about his life. I discovered that the page has been edited more than 4,000 times since it went up in 2003, back when Wikipedia user "Vera Cruz" posted the first biographical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=O._J._Simpson&amp;oldid=618861">snippet</a>. </p>
<p>Since then, users have slowly edited — and vandalized — the current bio's 5,000 words, a process I've charted below. </p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>This is, by far, my favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=O._J._Simpson&amp;oldid=12936722">edit</a>. Hint: <em>OJ Did It</em>. Later, this user got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=O._J._Simpson&amp;oldid=158424793">right to the point</a> in the first sentence. And this user <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=O._J._Simpson&amp;oldid=105816380">clearly wasn't a fan</a> (and should have his or her mouth washed out with soap). </p>
<p>The largest spikes in editing activity came in 2006, after O.J.'s controversial book proposal that flirted with a confession, and following his 2007 arrest in Las Vegas after an armed robbery scheme involving sports memorabilia.</p>
<p>First, we look at edits by year:</p>
<p><div class="pym-container" data-pym-src="http://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/oj-edits-year-20160621/child.html"></div></p>
<p>And then by month: </p>
<p><div class="pym-container" data-pym-src="http://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/oj-edits-months-20160621/child.html"></div></p>
<p>And, finally, this heat map shows edits by week and year. The spike in the fall of 2007 corresponds to O.J.'s arrest in Vegas: </p>
