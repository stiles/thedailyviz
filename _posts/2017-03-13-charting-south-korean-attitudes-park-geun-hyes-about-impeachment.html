<p>It's been a busy few days of reporting in South Korea. </p>
<p>The scandal-plagued president, Park Geun-hye, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-south-korea-park-impeach-2017-story.html">was removed from office</a> on Friday over a corruption scandal that has roiled politics and business in the country during the last six months. </p>
<p>Last night, two days after a court's ruling to remove her, Park <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-south-korea-20170312-story.html">finally left the presidential complex</a>.</p>
<p>The public overwhelmingly supported Park's ouster, even if the disgraced leader <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-south-korea-dysfunction-20170310-story.html">wasn't the source</a> of all their concerns. </p>
<p>As one might expect, opinions about whether the former president should have been impeached vary by age and region. Here are the results of a recent <a href="http://en.asaninst.org/contents/asan-korea-perspective-vol-2-no-6-2017-02-27-2017-03-10/#a6">survey</a> by Gallup Korea. </p>
<p>First, age (the youth led the way): </p>
<p><div class="pym-container" data-pym-src="http://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/park-impeachment-age-20170313/child.html"></div></p>
<p>And region (note that Daegu, in the southern part of the country, is Park's home turf):</p>
<p><div class="pym-container" data-pym-src="http://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/park-impeachment-region-20170313/child.html"></div></p>
