<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://thedailyviz.com/2013/06/15/mapping-minority-majority-counties/">mapped</a> the more than 350 "majority minority" counties in the United States, breaking them down by race and ethnicity groups and geography. As promised, today I've looked at how these counties (in the contiguous United States) voted in the 2012 election.</p>
<p>Obama won about 70 percent of these counties. Here's the map:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1429" align="alignnone" width="610"]<a href="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/minority-majority-2012.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1429" title="" alt="The Daily Viz" src="http://thedailyviz.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/minority-majority-2012-620x479.png" width="610"></a> The Daily Viz[/caption]</p>
<p>That map, of course, can be misleading — as often happens in elections. That because the area of the counties can distort their actual voting power. In this case, Obama won more "majority minority" counties with urban populations and many more voters, such as Los Angeles (Calif.), Cook (Ill.) and Kings (N.Y.) counties, among others. Romney carried rural Republican counties, largely in Texas and the west.</p>
<p>Obama received nearly 18 million votes in the "majority minority" counties he carried. Romney got 2 million votes in his "majority minority" counties. In the end, Obama received a net 10 million votes from "minority majority" counties — nearly double his national margin over Romney in the country as a whole.</p>
<p>The map below uses proportional circles on top of the choropleth map above to help visualize the total votes in each county. You can see how Obama won in many of the most-populous counties, increasing his national margin (though not necessarily helping with the Electoral College — except in critical purple states he carried, such as Florida and Virginia).</p>
