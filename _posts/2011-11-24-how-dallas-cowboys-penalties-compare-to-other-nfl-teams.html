<p>The Dallas Cowboys in recent years have been among the most-penalized teams in the NFL, a fact that may have contributed to their disappointing seasons.</p>
<p>This year, though, the team is averaging about 54 yards in penalties per game, roughly the same as the average NFL team (before tonight). <em>Oakland, by the way, has been penalized the most: 89 yards per game. Green Bay has been penalized the least: 36 yards per game. </em></p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at how the Cowboys compared with the NFL average in per-game penalty yards since 2003 (notice the numbers are down in 2010 and 2011 … because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flozell_Adams" target="_blank">Flozell Adams</a> left maybe??): </p>

<p>Here’s how the Cowboys have ranked among the 32 teams in the league. They were 31st in 2006 and 2008, but more recently have ranked closer to the middle of the pack: </p>

<p>I’m not sure how much these facts have contributed to the Cowboys’ win totals, but notice they were down in 2006 and 2008 (due to many other factors, I’m sure): </p>
