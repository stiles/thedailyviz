<p>My family is vacationing this week in Mosman, Australia, a <em>harbourside</em> Sydney suburb near Balmoral Beach known for its family friendly attractions and boutique shops. </p>
<p>This place is a great holiday spot. There's only one problem this year, though: It's been <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/sydney-and-nsw-feel-the-burn-of-a-hot-summer/news-story/13c5129c3e1d441689909c8be3527575?nk=9da8aa1f6edf16d138d749bc63ceb8bd-1514623315">quite hot</a>. </p>
<p>Sydney is normally relatively temperate during the summers, which occur opposite winters in the Northern Hemisphere. The average temperature in Celsius this time of year usually runs in the 25-degree range, or around 80 Fahrenheit. Today, though, was 35 degrees, or roughly 95 Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Have I mentioned that our vacation home doesn't have air conditioning?</p>
<p>We'll somehow survive, but the heat did prompt me to scrape some weather data.</p>
<p>During the last month Sydney has experienced severe heat spikes, some of them eclipsing records and even fueling wildfires. Last January, typically the hottest month here, there was a similar pattern.</p>
<p>This chart shows the year in temperatures. The color bars show the range of each day's highs and lows. The black step lines show historical averages. And the gray line shows the record highs. </p>
