<em>The New York Times</em> has posted aÂ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/us/death-and-disarray-at-americas-racetracks.html?hp" target="_blank">sad and troubling story</a> about the horse racing industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]n investigation by The New York Times has found that industry practices continue to put animal and rider at risk. A computer analysis of data from more than 150,000 races, along with injury reports, drug test results and interviews, shows an industry still mired in a culture of drugs and lax regulation and a fatal breakdown rate that remains far worse than in most of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/24/us/for-horse-and-jockey-risks-vary.html" target="_blank">chart and map</a> visualizing the rate of incidents at each track, showing how it varies by state:</p>
