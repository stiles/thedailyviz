<p>President Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1076256868190834689">thumbed</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/969408165308747777">his</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1049665483182694402">way</a> through another year in the White House on Twitter, compiling a good (great) collection of 2,930 touts, complaints, defenses and rants. </p>
<p>He left 2018 with <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1079906462753869825">this perplexing New Year's Eve missive</a> extolling the old-fashioned endurance of "Walls" and "Wheels" as one of his last. </p>
<p>As the message shows, the president's twitter presence lately is crowded by an increasingly evergreen list of grievances (Democrats, Russia, fake news, etc). Still, plenty of his messages actually correspond quite neatly with news events. </p>
<p>Notice how the #maga hashtag, a political rallying cry, disappears after the midterm elections. He talks about The Wall and shutdowns in and around the shutdowns, of course. And he decries Special Counsel Robert Mueller most often around the times his former aides have appeared (and been convicted or pleaded guilty) in federal court. </p>
<p>These examples are obvious when plotted on a timeline with annotation:<br />

<p>Through it all, the president's audience of followers grew steadily by 10 million users. He now has 56.7 million followers (me included). He's No. 15 on that measure, according to <a href="https://friendorfollow.com/twitter/most-followers/">friendorfollow.com</a>, sandwiched between heavy hitters like <a href="https://twitter.com/selenagomez">@selenagomez</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/britneyspears">@britneyspears</a>!<br />

<p>During 2018, @realDonaldTrump spread his tweets throughout the days of the week, with the president even finding time on the weekends to sound off:<br />
<div class="pym-container" data-pym-src="http://mattstiles.org/dailygraphics/graphics/trump-tweets-days-20180101/child.html"></div></p>
<p>This large collection of messages, scraped using <a href="https://github.com/twintproject/twint">twint</a>, drew more than 300 million of engagements, with "likes" being most common by far. <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992">This one</a> about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a year ago received a whopping 475,000 likes, topping the list. </p>
<p>Here's how those engagements split proportionally:<br />

<p>Speaking of retweets, there were 57 million in 2018. They came at the rate of 200,000 per day in some months. <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1016079192604139520">This popular "they-just-don't-get-it" mashup of video clips</a>, for example, received more than 110,000 retweets alone in July:<br />

<p>And, finally, as in years past, those messages were a mix of endorsements, promotions, defenses and complaints. Among the more popular keywords (sorry, no word clouds here):<br />
