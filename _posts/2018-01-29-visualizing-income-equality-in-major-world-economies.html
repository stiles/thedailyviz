<p>Years after a global crisis, the world's largest economies are again growing, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/business/its-not-a-roar-but-the-global-economy-is-finally-making-noise.html">reported</a> over the weekend. </p>
<blockquote><p>Every major economy on earth is expanding at once, a synchronous wave of growth that is creating jobs, lifting fortunes and tempering fears of popular discontent.</p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/stiles/status/957555637805658113">tweet</a> on the subject prompted a friend to respond with a <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDelury/status/957607697540509698">question</a> about whether income inequality has grown — and that in turn prompted a quick exploration of <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">data</a> provided by the World Bank.</p>
<p>One of its many indicators is the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI">GINI index</a>, which measures income distribution by country and creates a score. A 0 score means absolute equality, and 100 represents absolute inequality. </p>
<p>These data, based on country-by-country surveys, are imperfect and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mY34Om_9CsEKl5nLYc6adV8CJkAmfZ2fAjZG0a5JCs0/edit?usp=sharing">incomplete</a>, with most countries missing several years of data. The United States, for example, had only five annual estimates in the last two decades. South Korea, where I live now, had only four. Strangely, a few smaller countries had more complete data. Honduras had all but one year, for example.</p>
<p>Given these limits, I focused on the top-25 economies, some of which were missing scores. <em>In these cases, I carried over the most-recent data to maintain a consistent, if imprecise, trend line.</em> </p>
<p>The data are interesting in some cases. Here are the countries, listed in order of their gross national product <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)">rankings</a>:  </p>
