<p>Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving generally enjoy a good bird, myself included. But is that the case in some years more than others? </p>
<p>This chart shows turkey production (254 million this year) normalized by the number of households estimated each year by the U.S. Census Bureau. In the sixties, turkeys were produced at lower per-household rates than, say, the 1990s. We're back down to about two turkeys per household now: </p>

<p>Who knows why this shift occurred. Perhaps diets changed, or people purchased more food in bustling economic times, like the 1990s, or we started importing turkey from China. Any ideas?</p>
<p>You can gobble up the turkey data <a href="http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/7D5BC88E-9CAF-39AA-BA97-9C6E918B9B69?pivot=short_desc">here</a>. </p>
