<p>Now that Texas Gov. <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/" target="_blank">Rick Perry</a>, R-Texas, is officially in the presidential race, reporters are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/us/politics/13donate.html?_r=1&amp;hp" target="_blank">noting</a> his campaign fundraising prowess as a possible strength that could propel him to the GOP nomination: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it is a credential Mr. Perry is unlikely to highlight that could make him the most formidable entrant in the Republican race so far: he is among the top political fund-raisers in the country, with a vast network of wealthy supporters eager to bankroll his presidential ambitions, and he has the potential to energize Republican donors who have shown only limited enthusiasm for the candidates already in the race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Perry has raised more than $100 million in his decade-long tenure as governor, including $39 million in the his 2010 re-election effort, according to <a href="http://www.ethics.state.tx.us/dfs/search_CF.htm" target="_blank">electronic campaign reports</a> in Texas.</p>
<p>Here are his fundraising totals by year: </p>
<p><img height="250" width="500" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chxl=1:%7C2001%7C2002%7C2003%7C2004%7C2005%7C2006%7C2007%7C2008%7C2009%7C2010%7C2011&amp;chxr=0,0,30&amp;chxs=0,676767,11.5,0,lt,676767%7C1,676767,11.5,0,lt,676767&amp;chxt=y,x&amp;chbh=a&amp;chs=500x250&amp;cht=bvg&amp;chco=0d4140&amp;chds=0,30&amp;chd=t:6.3,14.2,4.2,7,6.9,13.1,3.4,6.6,11.1,27.2,0.3&amp;chg=0,-1,1,1&amp;chma=0,5&amp;chtt=Rick+Perry+Fundraising"></p>
<p>And a breakdown of how much he’s raised from individual donors versus entities, such as law firms and political action committees: </p>
<p><img height="100" width="500" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chxl=0:%7C%7C25+million%7C50+million%7C75+million%7C100+million&amp;chxr=0,0,101&amp;chxs=0,676767,11.5,0,t,676767&amp;chxt=x&amp;chs=500x100&amp;cht=bhs&amp;chco=0d4140,8bc0bf&amp;chd=s:v,P&amp;chtt=Individual+vs.+Entity+Donations"></p>
<p>Nine in 10 dollars collected by Perry came from Texas donors, but he has raised money from every state (darker shades represent higher dollar amounts): </p>

<p>Here’s a map that visualizes totals donated per household in each state. You can see that Colorado, Delaware and Washington, D.C., gave at higher proportions than other states (except for Texas, of course): </p>

<p>Finally, here’s a word cloud that highlights the most common donor occupations listed by Perry’s campaigns over the years, eliminating the phrase “Best Efforts.” The latter phrase is required in state law if a campaign can’t identify a donor’s occupation. (The Perry team has done that quite a bit over the years). </p>
