# About

<div class="about-text">
  <p>Howdy.</p>

  <p>I'm a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthustiles">reporter and data journalist</a> based in Los Angeles. <a href="/">The Daily Viz</a>, launched in 2011, was my digital sketchpad â€” a place for creating and curating charts, maps, graphs and other data stories.</p>

  <p>This blog has been inactive for about five years and offline until recently, when I migrated it from WordPress to Github Pages with Jekyll. You can read the code <a href="https://github.com/stiles/thedailyviz">here</a>.</p>

  <p>These days I'm a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/profiles/matt-stiles">senior data and graphics editor</a> at CNN. I previously worked on the data desk at the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, after stints covering LA County and working for two years as a special correspondent with the newspaper in Seoul.</p>

  <p>Before the Times, I worked as an <a href="http://topics.wsj.com/person/S/matt-stiles/8047">economics correspondent</a> for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. Before that I was data editor at NPR and the first data applications editor at <a href="http://www.texastribune.org">The Texas Tribune</a>.</p>
